I'm beautiful, I know, 'cause it's the season/But what am I to do with all this beauty
Biology, I am an organism/I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

I'm liquid smooth/come touch me too/and feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth/come touch me too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe, about to fall

Capture me/or at least take my picture
Kuzurete yuku maeni
I'm pulsing
my blood is red and unafraid of/living/beginning to end

I'm liquid smooth/come touch me too/and feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth/come touch me too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe, about to fall

How I feel this river rushing through my veins/with no where else to go, it circles round

I'm liquid smooth/come touch me too/and feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth/come touch me too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe, about to fall

Capture me…
You like control, well I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you/Hurt me how you choose
Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck/As you kneel I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head,/Makes me forgive you

But how long, how long can we play this way
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you/But I know, I know, I know the rules

Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth/As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin/It cries a soft weep like mine

I'll sell, I'll sell my heart to you/What's my, what's my, what's my price/How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want/I want I want I want I want I want  
I think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by

Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?

I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down

But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die

Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?

Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Real men don't need other people/And real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public/Oh, I think I'm a real man.

Little boys cry and look around for comfort/And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say, "I can take that!"/Oh, you are my little boy

Though honestly sir, all I wanna do/Is get naked in front of you/So you can look me up and down/And tell me, "Well done girl, you're looking good!"

Real men keep cool in the face of a fire/Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat, 'cause they're above that, damn it/And oh, I'm gonna be a real man.

Though honestly sir, all I wanna do/Is get naked in front of you/So you can look me up and down/And give me your love for being so god

But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely/For a little while

So little boy, say you want me
'Cause when I can't take it, go ahead/Do it, do it 
You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a man
I'm here at my cliff looking down

I cannot bear you a son/But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own/For I, even I, even I am alone

I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking/Breaking, breaking me/Away from my cliff, I am looking down from

I cannot bear you a son/I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own/For I, even my, even mine is unknown

So let me go towards the morning star/With hope it won't disappear 
I am hungry/I have been hungry/I was born hungry
What do I need?

I am something/I have been something/I was born something
What could I be?

There is a light that I can see/But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see/That only appears in the dark of sleep

I am waiting/I have been waiting/I was born waiting/I was born waiting for that something/Just one something

I was born something/I was born

There is a light, I feel it in me/But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me
There is a dream and it sleeps in me/Keeps me awake in the night

Crying sets me free

And I wake every night

Crying sets me free
I'm all used up, pretty boy, over and over again
My nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy, what do they tell you/'Cause I've looked down at them not knowing why

And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on/Clickity-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night/Illuminate my pores, and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go

I know my room is a mess, over and over again/I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed and do what you came here to do/But first open up a window for me

And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in/As it softly glides along your back/And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up/So I can watch it alone

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night/Illuminate my pores, and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go

And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast 
There is a door to me/I've never seen it/Sometimes I get closer to it/But I've never found it

At twilight I almost had it/But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered/How could I have lost it?

Then one night at the park/I saw it with my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark/But at least I finally found it

It cried out a creak and opened/To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless, a violence
I named it: Love. 
Treasure Hunter, you are dead
the light of the world is fading/you cannot see the other end
your body's lost all feeling
those creatures of your woken mind/don't fear them or their hunger
forgive the sea, follow the tide/with the monsters on your shoulder

Pearl Diver, dive, dive deeper/Pearl Diver, dive, dive down
Pearl Diver, dive dive deeper/Pearl Diver, dive, dive down

Oh Hunter, if you didn't want/the beautiful so badly/perhaps you would've found it/in your spirit singing softly/but hunter you were human
don't forget it and go safely/and I, I'll live without you/though the struggle will be daily

Pearl Diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl Diver, dive, dive down
Pearl Diver, dive dive deeper
Pearl Diver, dive, dive down

Treasure Hunter, you are dead/the light of the world is fading
There's nobody better than you
It took me a while till I knew/But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?/It just took me a while till I knew

Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew/You just grew a little smarter too

So I don't blame you if you want to/Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but/Maybe when you tell your friends, you/Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be

There's some kind of burning inside me/It's kept me from falling apart/And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart/But it's kept me from falling apart

Now here I lay, as I wonder about you/Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart till it grew/You can see how it's blossomed for you

And I don't blame you if you want to/Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but/Maybe when you tell your friends, you/Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am

And I don't mean to make your heart blue/But could we be what we're meant to be?
I'm just about to beg you please, and/Then when you tell your friends, you can/Tell them what you saw in me, and/Not the way I used to be

'Cause there's nobody better than you. 
It feels so good
It feels so good
And right outside the door nobody knows
They’re right outside the door and they don’t know how it/Feels so good
It feels so good

I never was very good
I haven’t been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They’re right outside the door and they don’t know how it/Feels so good
It feels so good/ /And I don’t need anything other than you. 


I can still smell the fire/Even though it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair/And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

So darling, play your violin/I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear/The tide where I used to be/Though now I'm but a shell,
Oh babe,/Don't say sorry

Darling, play your violin/I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for, you/Just play your violin/And we will manage somehow.

I'll live in the bathtub/It's cool and clean/It's smooth and it's steady/It's all that I need

I broke our belongings/They're all on the floor
The room is now empty/Nothing left to throw

All the eggshells are on the ground/And I try, I'm trying to pick them up/But they crack and crumble, it's much too much/Too frail for me to touch

I'll live in the bathtub/Surrounded by tiles/All so square and so steady/I will die in their cool, cool arms

I broke what you gave me/But you kept giving/More/And I'm sorry for taking/But I keep wanting/More, more, more

All the eggshells are on the ground/And I try, I'm trying to pick them up/But they crack and crumble, it's much too much/Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground/And I try, I'm trying to pick them up/But Humpty Dumpty it's much too much/Too frail for me to touch

Humpty Dumpty/It's much too much.
There's a lie that I told to you/That now I can't tell the truth/And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night/I slept with a man you knew

Then in the morning I walked home alone/And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights/When they were that man you knew

You told me once/You were happy to have me/But I never gave me away

There's a lie that I told to you

I would give you my heart, I think/But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree/put my heart where I couldn't reach

I didn't mind, I adored him so
We forgot, and we left for home/And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown/ /And nobody knows my lover is buried underground,
nobody knows my lover is buried underground,
nobody knows my lover is buried underground

There's a lie that I told to you. 
I want you
I hold one card/That I can't use/But I want you

You're coming back/And it's the end of the world
We're starting over/And I love you darling/And I am done, dear

You're in the house/And I am here in the car/'Cause I just need a quiet place/Where I can scream
How I love you

I found you
I found the door/But when I stepped through/There was no floor

You're coming back/And it's the end of the world
We're starting over/And I love you darling/And I am done, dear

You're in the house/And I am here in the car/'Cause I just need a quiet place/Where I can scream/How I love you

I want you/I want you. 
Your room was square
I once noticed from there/In your bed, as you slept,/And I held my breath
Everything had its own place/And I wondered what space would I take/In the order you kept

I tried to eat like your girlfriend/Just tea in the night, I'd end up/Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside,/I would find/It's for you won't be mine

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned/God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for/But I was still waiting for something to earn

What is that quiet of snow in the night?
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming/A choir of mute/As they brace for the ground

Well that's my ride/Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here shake my hand/You make such a good man
Never once did you know me

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned/God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you offered me all that I yearned for/But I was still waiting for something to earn

Silly me, waiting. 
I love everybody/Because I love you
When you stood up/Walked away, barefoot/And the grass where you lay/Left a bed in your shape/I looked over it/And I ached

I love everybody
Because I love you
I don't need the city, and I/Don't need proof
All I need, darling/Is a life in your shape/I picture it, soft/And I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond

Reach out the car window/Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her;/I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a/Life in your shape/So I follow the white lines
Follow the while lines/Keep my eyes on the road/As I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah.
Mom, I'm tired/Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright/If I stay for a year or two?
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night/And I'll leave once I figure out/How to pay for my own life too

Mom, would you wash my back?
This once, and then we can forget/And I'll leave what I'm chasing/For the other girls to pursue

Mom, am I still young?
Can I dream for a few months more?

It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate/To the little place you would tell me about/When you'd sense that I'd want to escape

Texas is a land-locked state/It's a little bit far away/From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make/It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it/Anywhere, anywhere
But i've been anywhere and it's not what I want/I wanna be still with you

You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"see the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my austin nights
You're the breeze in my austin nights
You're the breeze in my austin nights 
There's a party and we're all going/And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking/And no one's going back
Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full and/Nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight/The boys are gonna go for/More more more

And I want a love that falls as fast/As a body from the balcony, and/I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat/Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough/But he wants a finale and I came prepared/And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring/And I've tried putting out/But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for/More more more
And change, change, change is gonna come, but/When, when, when?

And I want a love that falls as fast/As a body from the balcony, and/I want to kiss like my heart is chasing me down
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat/Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

And I want a love that falls as fast/As a body from the balcony, and/I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat/Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

I'm not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I wanna be what my body wants me to be 

The black hole/Of the/Window/Where you sleep

The night breeze/Carries/Something sweet/A peach tree

Wild women don't get the blues/But I find that/Lately I've been crying like a/Tall child

So please hurry leave me/I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sōde

One word from you and I would/Jump off of this/Ledge I'm on/Baby

Tell me "don't,"/So I can/Crawl back in

And I was so young/When I behaved/Twenty five

Yet now I find/I've grown into/A tall child

And I don't wanna go home yet/Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
I'm writing this at 3am

I don't need the world to see/That I've been the best I can be, but/I don't think I could stand to be/Where you don't see me

On sunny days I go out walking/I end up on a tree-lined street/I look up at the gaps of sunlight/I miss you more than anything

I don't need the world to see/That I've been the best I can be, but/I don't think I could stand to be/Where you don't see me

And autumn comes when you're not yet done/With the summer passing by, but/I don't think I could stand to be/Where you don't see me 
I don't smoke/Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it/Tasted true
And I don't smoke/Except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you/Makes the flame burn good

So if you need to be mean/Be mean to me/I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break/More than trinkets in your room/You can lean on my arm/As you break my heart

I'm what's left of when we/Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just/Waiting for when/You come down and tell me/I was meant for you, baby
Being with you/Makes the flame burn good

If you need to be mean/Be mean to me/I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break/More than trinkets in your room/You can lean on my arm/As you break my heart

Just don't leave me alone/Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me/Credit for

If your hands need to break/More than trinkets in your room/You can lean on my arm/As you break my heart 
It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food/Or the drive I need to go/Further than they said I'd go

He only loves me when/There's a means he means to end
Oh I miss when we first met/He didn't know me yet

So take me out baby/Makes no difference where we'll be/As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out baby

Take me out baby/Doesn't matter where we'll be/But please under the light of day/Take me out
Take me out
Take me out baby 
I will retire to the salton sea/At the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free/But though I may never be free/Fuck you and your money
I'm tired of your money

And I sit on the curb cause it's the prettiest night/With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you/These killer heels for you
See the dark it moves/With every breath of the breeze 
I will take good care of you
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good/If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night/And dry it off with care/I will see your body bare/And still I will live here

So stay with me/Hold my hand/There’s no need/To be brave

And all the quiet nights you bear/Seal them up with care/No one needs to know they’re there/For I will hold them for you

‘cause all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is/Always you/’It’s always you

And we’re not out of the tunnel/I bet you though there's an end

Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need/To be brave

And while you sleep/I'll be scared/So by the time you wake/I'll be brave
I'll be brave
I'll be brave 
At night/On the roof top/I untie my hair/And watch from my plastic chair/As my dark hair/Unleashes the night

The scent of flowers/Still in bloom from morning shower/And I/Say your name/In hopes you'll hear it in the stars/And carry me out
Carry me out

I drive when it rains
At night when it rains I drive/And the headlight spirits/They lead me down the styx/So black it shines/And carry me out

Carry me out 
All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy/They'll think of me kindly/When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room/With no thoughts/Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night/Carefully/I was going to live

You wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes/But I know through mine you were/Looking in yours
And did you know the liberty bell is a replica/Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night/Quietly/It was told to believe

I always wanted to die clean and pretty/But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted/I couldn't have changed anyways

I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye 
Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way/I poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
Well I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me/So he laid me down, and I felt happy, come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh if you're going, take the train/So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart/I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave/I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see/All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea/Well I sighed and mumbled to myself again, I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train/So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart/I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon/Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart/I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you 
Dan had very long limbs/From leading day to day/Lean onto a cliff/That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands/He would smile and/Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand/His whole life

When he'd say goodnight and/Leave her doorstep/He'd use his last strength/To wave back
And once back in his room/Once back in his room/He'd return his waving hand/Back to its cliff
He liked it more than life itself/I'm sure

Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room/When no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
So when he moved with you/And felt his body let go/Of course you couldn't know/It was you and you alone/That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
He would never tell you that it was his first time 
In the rearview mirror/I saw the setting sun on your neck/And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us/Our every move/We do have reputations
We keep it secret/Won't let them have it

So come inside and be with me/Alone with me
Alone/With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses/Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you/Once more to see you

Come inside and be with me/Alone with me/Alone/With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses/Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you/Once more to see you
If I could see you/Once more to see you 
One morning this sadness will fossilize/And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work and you won't see a change/Save perhaps a slight gray in my eye

I will go jogging routinely/Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side/I'll pull it out without questioning why

And then one warm summer night/I'll hear fireworks outside/And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

I will be married to silence/The gentleman won't say a word/But you know, oh you know in the quiet he holds/Runs a river that will never find home

And then one warm summer night/I'll hear fireworks outside/And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry/Oh, one warm summer/I'll hear fireworks outside/And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry/Cry, cry, cry 
If I could, I'd be your little spoon/And kiss your fingers forevermore/But, big spoon, you have so much to do/And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night/But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star/But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

Don't wait for me, I can't come

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me/But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy/I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me/But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy/I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me/But I do, I think do 
My baby, my baby/You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby/Tell your baby that I'm your baby

I bet on losing dogs/I know they're losing and I pay for my place/By the ring/Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down/I'll be there on their side/I'm losing by their side

Will you let me, baby/Lose on losing dogs/I know they're losing and I pay for my place/By the ring/Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down

I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine

How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I cum
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs 

[BREAK]
I'm not doing anything
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars/And I'm not doing anything
I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Come find me

I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill me 
Glory, glory, glory to the night that shows me what I am/As I go to the party on my knees/Saying take it all please

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody please/Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory, glory, glory to the night/It shows me what I am
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down/And always bad

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody please/Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here/Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no 
What do you do with a loving feeling/If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling/If they only love you when you're all alone?

Holding hands under the table/Meeting up in your bedroom/Making love to other people/Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me

What do you do with a loving feeling/If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling/If they only love you when you're all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling/If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling/If they only love you when you're all alone?

You only love me when we're all alone 
Down empty streets sniffing glue me and you
Blank open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long hard twenty-year summer vacation/All these twenty years trying to fill the void

Crack baby you don't know what you want/But you know that you had it once/And you know that you want it back
Crack baby you don't know what you want/But you know that you're needing it/And you know that you need it bad
With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

Went to your room thinking maybe you'll feel something/But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation

Crack baby you don't know what you want/But you know that you had it once/And you know that you want it back
Crack baby you don't know what you want/But you know that you're needing it/And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby you don't know what you want/But you know that you want it/Yeah you know that you want it/You know that you
Crack baby you don't know what you want/But you know that you need it/And you know that you need it bad
With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones 
Today I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things/And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire/And I am the fire and I am the forest/And I am a witness watching it/I stand in a valley watching it/And you are not there at all

So today I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat/Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work and I'll go to sleep/And I'll love the littler things/I'll love some littler things
You're my number one
You're the one I want/And you've turned down/Every hand that has beckoned me to come

You're my number one
You're the one I want/And I've turned down every hand/That has beckoned me to come

'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got/So I'll keep turning down the hands/That beckon me to come

Though I'm a geyser/Feel it bubbling from below/Hear it call, hear it call
Hear it call to me/Constantly/And hear the harmony/Only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real/It's not real enough

But I will be the one you need/The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need/I just can't be without you 
I know that I ended it, but/Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do/So why didn't you stop me?

Why didn't you stop me/And paint it over?

I look for a picture of you/To keep in my pocket/But I can't seem to find one/Where you look how I remember
Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over 
We nearly drowned/For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now/Better than you
And that pretty friend is/Finally yours, and/I'll be around on Sunday, if/You'll meet me at blue diner/I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby/At blue diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby

I haven't told anyone/Just like we promised/Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from/I squeeze a little

Meet me at blue diner/I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby/At blue diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
At blue diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby/Blue diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby

You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me/And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry I don't want your touch/It's not that I don't want you
Sorry I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended/And it left a pearl in my head/And I roll it around/Every night, just to watch it glow/Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry I don't want your touch/It's not that I don't want you
Sorry I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill/You fill, you fill

But it's just that I fell in love with a war/And nobody told me it ended/And it left a pearl in my head/And I roll it around/Every night, just to watch it glow/Every night, baby that's where I go/Just to watch it glow

I call you, to see you again/So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup/To prove something

Walk up in my high heels/All high and mighty/And you say, "Hello"/And I lose

'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and/Nobody fucks me like me

In the morning, in a taxi/I'm so very paying for
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?
I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?/That I can save for tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name/After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky/Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me/To finally call it heaven?

To finally get somewhere I can be all done/Somewhere like heaven 
Come into the water!
Do you wanna be my baby?/Are you waiting to touch me?
You look so good, but I keep my hands/Til you come into the water

Maybe I'm the same as all those men/Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me?/'Cause I can't move until you show me

I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me?/'Cause I can't move until you show me 
I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute/And then I'll be nothing forever/And all of my memories/And all of the things I have seen will be gone/With my eyes with my body with me

But me and my husband/We are doing better/It's always been just him and me/Together
So I bet all I have on that/Furrowed brow/And at least in this lifetime/We're sticking together
Me and my husband/We're sticking together

And I'm the idiot with the painted face/In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved

Me and my husband/We are doing better/It's always been just him and me/Together
So I bet all I have on that/Furrowed brow/And at least in this lifetime/We're sticking together
Me and my husband/We're sticking together
Me and my husband/We are doing better 
My God, I'm so lonely/So I open the window/To hear sounds of people/To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love/Was destroyed by global warming/Did its people want too much too?
Did its people want too much?

And I don't want your pity/I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me/I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss/And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small and/Big and small and/Big and small again/And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me/I’m just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss/And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no 
I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you/And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight/Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower/With every drop of rain singing/"I love you, I love you, I love you/I love you, I love you, I love you/I love you, I love you, I love you!"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but/I didn't do it right/Can I try again, try again, try again/Try again, and again, and again/And again, and again, and again 
A lake with no fish/Is the heart of a horse/Named Cold Air/Who, when young/Would run like a storm/They would say

I thought I'd traveled a long way/But I had circled/The same old sin 
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart/Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick/I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby will you kiss me already and/Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart/Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes/I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me? 
Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night/Singing, "Do-do, do-do..."

Out there I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?/Are you?

"Do-do, do-do..." 
Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?/It's funny how they're all the same/It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before/It's funny how I still forgot

It would be a hundred times easier/If we were young again/But as it is/And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down/You see it on both our skin/We get a few years and then it wants us back

It would be a hundred times easier/If we were young again/But as it is/And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same/But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out 

I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I want to jump into blue water
And I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
I was meant for running fast
I pretended you were mine, it made me calm, babe

I am cruel, I am gentle, I can make you laugh
I am cruel, I am gentle, I can make you laugh
I've loved many boys, I've loved many girls
I don't think about the past, it's always there anyway
Don't think about the past, always there anyway
And I will never die, I will never die
I will never die
I will never die
I will never die
I will never die
I will never die
I will never die

I've preemptively blocked all the exits
I've preemptively blocked all the exits/So I will burn in this movie theater, hey
